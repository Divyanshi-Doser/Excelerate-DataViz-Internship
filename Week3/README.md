# Week 3 – Facebook Ads Campaign Optimization Presentation 📊  

This folder contains the **Week 3 presentation and feedback report** from my **Data Visualization Trainee Internship at Excelerate**.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Created a **presentation** on optimizing Facebook Ads Campaigns for GlobalShala’s Superhero U event.  
- Evaluated campaign performance based on **CTR, CPC, CPR, reach, and impressions**.  
- Recommended discontinuing underperforming campaigns and reallocating budget to high ROI ads.  
- Developed a **Marketing Strategy Action Plan** including pausing weak ads, redirecting budgets, and testing new creatives.  

### 🔑 Key Findings  
- Campaign **2 & 8** → Best performers with low CPC and high engagement.  
- Campaign **3** → Weakest link due to high CPC and poor ROI.
